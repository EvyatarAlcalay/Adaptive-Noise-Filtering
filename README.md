# Adaptive Noise Filtering (LMS / NLMS / RLS)

A signal processing project focused on **adaptive noise filtering** using algorithms such as LMS, NLMS, and RLS.  
Includes MATLAB implementations, experiments on real audio files, performance plots, and NRdB evaluation.

## üìÇ Repository Structure


## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- MATLAB R2020a or later  
- Built-in functions such as `audioread`, `audiowrite`, `toeplitz`  
- Example audio files placed in `data/raw` (airplane, cafe, city, vacuumcleaner)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1) Running Adaptive_Filters.m by Sections:
   -Open MATLAB and set the Current Folder to the repository root. Make sure the .wav files are accessible from this folder
   -Open Adaptive_Filters.m
   -The script is divided into Sections (marked with %%). Each section corresponds to a specific question. Run them one by one using Run Section (Ctrl+Enter)
Mapping Sections:
-%% The code for section 4,5 in Q1 ‚Äì Generates AR(1) process, computes statistics (mean/second moment), finds Œ≤, runs optimal filters for 
ùêø
=
1..5
L=1..5, computes NRdB.
2) Running adaptivepredict.m
   -This function receives a vector of samples z_1,...,z_n (e.g. an audio segment) and z\hat_(n-1) returns the predicted next sample.
   -It internally tests multiple parameter sets for RLS and LMS and selects the one that achieves the best NRdB.
   Example:
   Z = audioread('airplane.wav');   % or any other signal
   Z = Z(:,1);                      % if stereo, use one channel
   znext = adaptivepredict(Z);

   Inside the function:
   -RLS is tested with L_values_RLS = [10 20 30], lambda_vals = [0.01, 0.5, 0.999], delta = 1.
   -LMS is tested with L_values_LMS = [5 10 15], mu_vals = [0.85 9 0.01]
   Note: some Œº values (e.g., Œº=9) are aggressive and may be unstable; they were included for experimentation.


## üìä Main Experiments

-Steepest Descent: Step-size effect and weight error convergence.
-LMS/NLMS: Convergence speed and misadjustment for different parameters.
-RLS: Effect of forgetting factor (Œª) and initialization (Œ¥).
-Audio Denoising: Instantaneous power plots, NRdB calculations, and side-by-side comparison of noisy vs denoised signals.

## üìà Results
-Figures saved to results/figures/
-Denoised audio saved to results/audio/
